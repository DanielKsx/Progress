        <p>[Chorus: Rihanna]</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?</p>
        <p>Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?</p>
        <p>Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie</p>
        <p>I love the way you lie</p>

        <p>[Verse 1: Eminem]</p>
        <p>I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like</p>
        <p>And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe</p>
        <p>I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight</p>
        <p>As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight</p>
        <p>High off of love, drunk from my hate</p>
        <p>It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate</p>
        <p>And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me</p>
        <p>She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait</p>
        <p>Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you" — "No, you ain't</p>
        <p>Come back" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again</p>
        <p>It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great</p>
        <p>I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane</p>
        <p>But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed</p>
        <p>I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name</p>
        <p>I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again</p>
        <p>I guess I don't know my own strength</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Rihanna]</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?</p>
        <p>Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?</p>
        <p>Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie</p>
        <p>I love the way you lie</p>
        <p>I love the way you lie</p>
