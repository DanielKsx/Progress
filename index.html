        <p>[Chorus: Rihanna]</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
           Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts<br>
           Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
           Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie<br>
           I love the way you lie</p>

        <p>[Verse 1: Eminem]</p>
        <p>I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like<br>
           And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br>
           I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight<br>
           As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight<br>
           High off of love, drunk from my hate<br>
           It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate<br>
           And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me<br>
           She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Waitt<br>
           Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you" — "No, you ain't<br>
           Come back" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again<br>
           It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great<br>
           I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br>
           But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed<br>
           I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name<br>
           I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again<br>
           I guess I don't know my own strength</p>

        <p>[Chorus: Rihanna]</p>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
           Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts<br>
           Just gonna stand  there and hear me cry?<br>
           Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie<br>
           I love the way you lie<br>
        <p>I love the way you lie</p>
